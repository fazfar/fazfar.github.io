                    in the Americas.
                    This recognition is awarded to Muslim professionals who have authentically embraced their faith in
                    the workplace, and through their efforts have brought about positive impact in their communities.
                    <br><br>
                    In my work at West Monroe I sought out community through the development and founding of our
                    Interfaith ERG. It has become a phenomenal platform to increase awareness and inclusiveness of
                    Muslim colleagues alongside those of other faiths. I was one of our cofounders of the ERG, which
                    launched in 2021.
