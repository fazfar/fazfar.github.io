# fazfar.github.io
A personal website hosted on GitHub
How to build one too:
1. create a new PUBLIC repository with your username.github.io as the name. I created fazfar.github.io as my username is fazfar.
2. create an index.html file, and add your html to that file. Something easy to see something quick:
```
<div>hello world!</div>
```
3. save. See your new website on https://fazfar.github.io (or https://username.github.io)
